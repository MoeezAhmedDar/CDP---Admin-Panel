Notes of orange rinds, fresh lemons, and a hint of cream dominate this strain from its Beta-Pinene, Limonene, and Linalool terpenes. Orange Tree is high-THC with potential to reach 30% THC levels. Plants are flushed for two full weeks to ensure the purest flavour possible. Every strain cultivated is hand-harvested, hang-dried, and hand-trimmed with a minimum cure of three weeks."
